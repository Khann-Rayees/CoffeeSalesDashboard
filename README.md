# CoffeeSalesDashboard
This is an Excel Project in which I had created a Dashboard for Coffee Sales using Pivot Tables, Slicers and utilised the excel analytical skills.
Here are the key terms and concepts used in the Excel project summary:
- **Excel Project**: A comprehensive exercise that involves data collection, transformation, and visualization using Microsoft Excel.
- **Data Gathering**: Collecting and organizing data from various sources, such as customer and product tables, into a unified dataset.
- **XLOOKUP**: A formula in Excel used to search a range or table for a specific value and return a corresponding value from another range or table.
- **INDEX MATCH**: A combination of two Excel functions used for dynamic data lookup, providing more flexibility compared to simple lookup functions.
- **Pivot Tables**: A data summarization tool in Excel that allows users to automatically sort, count, and total data from a large dataset.
- **Pivot Charts**: Visual representations of data summarized by pivot tables, which help in creating interactive and dynamic reports.
- **Slicers**: Visual filters in Excel that allow users to easily filter data in pivot tables and charts based on selected criteria.
